## Nicola Cortese

After what seemed like an eternity working in finance (6 years) I decided that maybe my side-dabbling in programming could turn into something more. I'm really excited to have started my journey as a developer. At Makers I've had the opportunity to meet incredible people and to fill this CV with interesting projects and experiences

## Skills

#### Teamplayer/Mediator

Working as part of a bigger team at Universal and Bossa Studios has shown me the importance of being able to work with different people. I recognise that all members of a team will bring a different set of skills to a project, and I enjoy helping them apply those competences to their fullest. In my latest projects at Makers I have always encouraged all members to voice their concerns and opinions. By doing so, nobody felt left behind or discouraged, we were all motivated through participation and inclusion. Each member developed a stronger sense of agency and this resulted in enhanced productivity for the whole team.


#### Problem solver

Creating a bowling scorecard was one of the biggest technical challenges I faced at makers. The intricacies of the scoring system are complex and hard to replicate through code. Researching the task was vital to understand how to model my program.  By breaking down the task into smaller and more manageable problems, I was able to approach it incrementally. First I separated the bowling frames into their own class, as they required to hold a state that would influence the score of future frames. Then, through TDD I expanded my code to include the various cases that could have occured (spare and strike). The behaviour of the 10th (final) frame differed from the previous ones, I therefore decided to create a new class that would inherit from the original. By separating them it resulted in DRYier and more readable code.


#### Time Management

Having worked at the heart of a big corporation and a smaller gaming studio, I have seen the inner plumbing of how a business operates. By being responsible for the accounts I understand the importance of prioritising tasks when deadlines are fast approaching. On a monthly basis I would close the ledgers and use the data to report back the performance of the company to the senior management team. By being methodical, I used a schedule with the required daily tasks, I managed not only to avoid any delays in the process, but I also factored in buffer time to tackle any unexpected problems that would arise at the last minute.
